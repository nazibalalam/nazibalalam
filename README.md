I am a linux enthusiast and a programmer. I like system programming the most. I'm fluent in Python and Java. I'm also interested with Go and Rust. Currenty I'm learning Flutter (at least so I can get a taste of front-end stuff). I'm also focusing on competetive programming to increase My problem solving skills.

And last but not least, I'm an expert with all kinds of linux stuff (general linux usage, distros, command-line tools, RICING! and stuff like that). If you don't believe me, let's get down to a challenge!

And I use arch, **btw**

PS: I'm bad at making profiles, especially profile pictures :(
